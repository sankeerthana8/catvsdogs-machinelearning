Fill in cells below and fit neural networks for solving the binary classification task.

**Requirement**
- Python, Pytorch (Must), and all other necessary libraries
- **Just don't cheat, Thanks!**
- Sample output is to help you understand the task, and get an idea of what you have to do
- Dur date is Nov 10, 11:59pm. You ONLY need to submit this notebook. Include instructions to run your code.

## Task 1(25 points):

1. Build and fit CNN with 3 convolutional layers for binary classification
2. Evaluate accuracy on test data
3. Plot the graphs for Loss(number_of_epochs) and Accuracy(number_of_epochs)

First, let's load all the necessary functions:
